  <h1>Founder Stories</h1>
  <p>As part of the rollout of <a href="http://kinhr.com" target="_blank">Kin</a>, we developed a video series telling the stories of the challenges new and successful small Chicago businesses face. These videos tell a bit about the difficulties of scaling a business, maintaining a company culture, and the stress of hiring and onboarding new employees. Produced by Kin and directed by <a href="http://frankandharvey.com" target="_blank">Frank &amp; Harvey</a>, these videos paint a very good picture of the problems Kin seeks to address for small businesses all over the country.</p>

  <h1>One City Tees</h1>
  <p>One tee that combines so many of my loves: black and white, the American flag, the Chicago flag, brayer textures and my home. The One City Tee was definitely a labor of love. Initially, this was just a tee I thought up and wanted to get printed but couldn't justify the cost of screenprinting a single shirt. Luckily, it caught the attention of the Chicago Design Museum and Cotton Bureau. With wider distribution and a larger audience, I was super pumped to bring this tee to life. It was originally available at Chicago Design Museum in June 2013 and online at Cotton Bureau, but now it's only availble in my <a href="http://jasonjam.es/shop">Shop</a>.</p>

  <h1>Very Hot Lunch</h1>
  <p>Very Hot Lunch is a design collective that meets after hours to make digital products that help people. We're pretty deep into making our first app, <i>Let's Eat</i> &ndash; a gluten-free dining locator. We needed to get something up fast to let people know a little bit about who we are. The <a href="http://veryhotlunch.com" target="_blank">splash page</a> feeds in a big ass tweet because we live-blog every part of our process. We also post our progress at our <a href="http://blog.letseatapp.com" target="_blank">process blog</a>.</p>

  <h1>Gogo Air</h1>
  <p>You know when you’re on a plane and are trying to connect to wifi? The wifi is Gogo Air. Sometimes you get thirty minutes for free. That’s because of a corporate sponsor.</p>
  <p>Gogo Air was in a bad spot, creating custom one-off pages for each sponsor. These are a few example pages for the system I designed with <a href="http://brightbrightgreat.com" target="_blank">Bright Bright Great</a> for how advertisers would integrate their different looks into the Gogo Air log-in/authentication process while maintaining consistent usability, both for laptops and mobile devices.</p>

  <h1>AARP Foundation's Youth Campaign</h1>
  <p>The 18-24 year old demographic is known for their desire to make a difference in the world, but there's little education or awareness for them around the issues fifty and older Americans face on a daily basis. <i>Unconditional</i> is AARP and AARP Foundation's campaign to raise awareness with the younger generation and encourage advocacy for one of the most vulnerable groups in America, those aged fifty to sixty-five.</p>
  <p>I concepted and created the art direction and pitch creative. The look is raw and serious while at the same time human and empathetic.</p>

  <h1>Chicago Community Trust's Leadership Campaign Microsite</h1>
  <p>The Trust is looking to dramatically increase their capitalization. Normally, they focus on the good work they do in Chicago through their grants. However, in order to really speak to a high-end donor in a sophisticated and targeted way, they worked with Lipman Hearne to launch a leadership campaign called <i>We Are Chicago</i>. The campaign appeals to very wealthy prospective donors by highlighting major donors who are leaving a legacy in the city right now and by emphasizing the Trust's efficiency and history of community impact.</p>

  <h1>University of Wisconsin's Annual Fund Campaign: Share The Wonderful</h1>
  <p>UW-Madison and the UW Foundation needed to raise $10 million dollars in 2012 to help the University continue its excellent teaching and research in spite of diminishing state funds. For the first time in their history, they enlisted the help of an agency to lead the marketing efforts of their Annual Fund Campaign. Lipman Hearne was one of eight agencies competing for the work.</p>
  <p>Leading up to the pitch, I designed all the digital spec work, and after winning I continued to art direct the project to completion. Share The Wonderful is the name of the campaign, and our goal and my personal ambition with the project was to make each facet of the campaign feel like a gift to the person on the other side of the screen. The campaign began in mid-September 2012, and by mid-December it had exceeded its 10 million dollar goal.</p>

ZRS focuses on the pseudo-science of zombie medical research. They take the “imminent” zombie apocalypse very, very serious. Therefore, the design walks a thin line, balancing clinical and horror film aesthetics.</p>
