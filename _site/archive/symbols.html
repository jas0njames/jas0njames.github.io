<h1>Symbols, Narrative & Unformed Brains</h1>
<p>When I was about seven or eight, after watching an episode of MacGyver or Indiana Jones or Stars Wars or something like that, my chubby little second grade body couldn&rsquo;t contain the adrenaline pumping through my veins from the excitement. So like a gamehunter on a safari, I sought a challenge worthy of my testosterone. Who or what could pose an Indiana-Joneseque, MacGyverish challenge? That thought turned over and over in my head; only one beast could test my blossoming manhood. Escaping the garage door would be my rite of passage&mdash;my initiation into the society of adventurers.</p>
<p>I could see it all so clearly: the garage door edges down moment after moment threatening to trap me in the garage forever, ultimately sealing my fate. I&rsquo;m drenched with sweat and sporting a five o&rsquo;clock shadow, straining with all my might to outrun the garage door with a beautiful blonde starlet at my side. She&rsquo;d be so frightened, but I&rsquo;d save her first. After tossing her across the threshold, she turns and scream for me to dive under the door as well. I&rsquo;d pause and say something clever or daring. Just as I&rsquo;m about to dive for safety, a small child cries or a dog barks or both. At that moment, I&rsquo;m forced to turn back. All the while, the door moves downward&mdash;-ever downward. I have the dogchild in my arms, yet all hope seems lost. My saintly damsel by now is crying, out of fear and anxiety. And with one last heroic gesture, I muster the last of my strength and sprint, dive, slide under the garage door. The music builds, then swells, then slowly descend into an emotive piano ballad. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<h4>I had to do it&mdash;my life and the future of the world depended on it.</h4>
<p>I heaved myself up from the living room floor and walked through the house, past my dad in the family room, and into the garage. The moment of truth had arrived. This would be the day I would join the likes of MacGyver, Van Damme, and Seagal. Boldly, I raised the garage door with the wall-mounted controller. I thought for a moment about how to create a more daring scenario. All the way up posed little to no threat. I&rsquo;d hit the button and run under countless times with plenty of time to spare. If I lowered the garage door to the halfway-point then I&rsquo;d really have a challenge. Halfway just made sense.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a brief moment to put this event in context. It&rsquo;s circa 1991. The garage doors in these times consisted of some sort of heavy metal and wood&mdash;weighing in the hundreds of pounds. Far different than today&rsquo;s feather-light aluminum doors. Also, not yet invented, garage door sensors; clearly, they were developed as a way to curb the dangers of the garage door to idiot children.</p>
<p>So there I was: fingers perched on the button, heart pounding. I pushed the button. The garage door lurched and began its descent. Life moved in slow motion for those next few seconds. I ran, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as powerful or courageous as I had envisioned. By the time I reached the threshold, the opening was down to maybe a foot and a half. But I couldn&rsquo;t chicken out, so I dove with all my might. Only my dive was like a baseball player sliding into home plate&mdash;hands first and on my stomach. Which, if you have ever tried sliding on concrete, isn&rsquo;t a good idea. Only half of me cleared the garage door. I needed to crawl or drag my lower half through, and time was running out!</p>
<p>I felt the pressure of the garage door on my back pinning me to the ground. Half in and half out, I squirmed trying to push the door up, like the world&rsquo;s heaviest push up. I pressed and fought, and then I realized, &ldquo;This is it. I&rsquo;m going to die. This is how I&rsquo;m going to die. I&rsquo;m only eight, and I&rsquo;m dead--like this.&rdquo; That was the last thing I remember before blacking out.</p>
<p>Eventually&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure how long I was unconscious&mdash;I woke up. Face planted in the driveway, I looked like I was taking a strange nap. Slowly my senses returned.</p>
<h4>I realized this was not heaven, but rather the oil-stained concrete of my driveway.</h4>
<p>I was still alive. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. The garage door had gone back up at some point. Thank God. I picked myself up and dusted myself off. Nothing felt sore or in pain. After I determined I was fine, the embarrassment began to set in. I got crushed by my garage door trying to be Indiana Jones. What the hell was I thinking?</p>
<p>In hindsight, I realize boredom didn&rsquo;t compel me to tango with death. I could have found countless other ways to entertain myself&mdash;video games, basketball, reading&mdash;I was enraptured by a narrative and symbol. The daring, mysterious and gruff man symbolizing an idea of what I wanted to be, and his narrative of intrigue, suspense and romance was the life I wanted to lead for however fleetingly I could envision it. It&rsquo;s always been easy to think back on that day as a really stupid act of a restless kid, but now I understand my unformed frontal lobe couldn&rsquo;t examine critically the narrative and symbols I was visually ingesting. So I bought into a completely fabricated idea because it resonated in a personal way.</p>
<p>Now, the scary thought is what logically follows next:</p>
<h4>Are there any narratives I&rsquo;m unknowingly buying into merely because they&rsquo;ve been positioned in a way that resonates with something human and personal within me? Likely, the answer&rsquo;s yes.</h4>
<p>So maybe I don&rsquo;t make as stupid of decisions like nearly killing myself with a garage door, but I can think back on at least a few equally stupid narratives I&rsquo;ve bought into that just happened to not be as deadly. All that to say, consider your use and interaction with narratives and symbols. They&rsquo;re incredibly powerful devices to utilize in creative work. And also, give thorough consideration to the symbols and narratives you&rsquo;re engaging with on a daily basis.</p>
