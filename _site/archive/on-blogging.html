<h1>On Blogging & Wonder</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard plenty of complaints over the last few years, many of them mine, about the impact the internet has had on our lives&mdash;issues of technology anxiety, information overload, chronic attachment to screens instead of faces. And these observations are valid, technology <em>has</em> complicated life. In fifteen years, the internet has grown from a frivolous luxury to absolutely essential. No longer do we dial up once a week to check our America Online email accounts, but now our email resides in our pants and purses, immediately notifying us the instant the latest email / text / IM / tweet / status / buzz / bloop / blip arrives.</p>
<p>Technology of course has its pro&rsquo;s and its con&rsquo;s. And those are worth understanding and considering, but mostly, I mention these things because I was struck today by something. In the past, I&rsquo;ve found myself dismissive of blogs. And by blogs I mean the small personal sites where people talk about their lives and cats and &ldquo;musings,&rdquo;&mdash;not blogs the way some people consider the Huffington Post or Pitchfork blogs. Millions of Americans have blogs, and the reality is very few of them see any traffic for various reasons but mostly (in my opinion) because the content sucks.</p>
<p>However, if you consider blogging sans cyncism, it&rsquo;s really a tremendous idea and beautiful exchange. Granted there&rsquo;s a ton of entirely&nbsp;asinine&nbsp;blogs out there (maybe this one). But with an iota of focus and intention, people can generate and share really distinct and wonderful facets of their personality. But let&rsquo;s get specific though: I&rsquo;ve been struck by how many people I know are sharing very personal, very human parts of themselves with the world.</p>
<p>My friend Christina, after a decade-long struggle with depression and addiction started a blog last week to <a href="http://welcometothelaundromat.blogspot.com/2011/06/welcome-to-laundromat.html" target="_blank">share about those very issues</a>. Another friend, Sherri Bankord, after raising four emotionally healthy kids has begun offering remarkably pratical and useful parenting tips in a <a href="http://ithasworkedforme.com/2011/05/10/say-yes-as-much-as-possible/" target="_blank">brand new blog</a>. Jason Harper, an aspiring&nbsp;filmmaker, shares not just a carefully curated feed of films clips, but posts his <a href="http://jmharper.blogspot.com/2011/06/last-nights-dream.html" target="_blank">original poems</a>. And a friend of friend, Matt Miller, was recently deployed to Afghanistan. I don&rsquo;t know him, but I know friends who care deeply about him. So his <a href="http://evanuel3.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">infrequent updates</a> from the other side of the world matter a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Blogs used to only be about page hits, quality writing, and interesting content to me. But perhaps there&rsquo;s another purpose&hellip;maybe we blog merely because we&rsquo;re people. We want to be known, and we want to help people. We blog because we can&rsquo;t help <em>but</em> blog. Yeah, sometimes the writing is crap and the thoughts are half-formed, but perhaps there&rsquo;s something more important&nbsp;than commas and em dashes&nbsp;happening.</p>
<p>I suppose for all the whining and bitching that you or I or <a href="http://happysin.felixculpagroup.com" target="_blank">Arcade Fire</a> do about simpler times and the pre-internet glory days, we should take just a brief moment to reflect on the fact that we get to know our friends and family in new and incisive ways merely because this platform was created. For all the dehumanizing aspects of technology, it&rsquo;s dumbfounding that I can encounter Parent-Sherri, Recovered-Addict-Christina, Part-time-Poet-Jason, and Soldier-Friend-of-a-Friend-Matt online because honestly these conversations wouldn&rsquo;t have <em>ever</em> occurred offline.</p>
<p>So should we all check our email a bit less? Yeah, probably. And should we spend more time looking into eyes instead of screens? Yes. But you and I can rest a little easier that this new digital wifi world still has some humanity in it. On the other side of these screens&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;there&rsquo;s a real person, just trying to share a little bit of themselves with the world, and that&rsquo;s a beautiful and&nbsp;wondrous&nbsp;thing.</p>
