  <h1>We Are Mammoth</h1>
  <p>Historically, We Are Mammoth has been a development shop. In 2012, I came aboard to design their software products, but the company has grown in reputation for design since then. In order to reflect our expanded user experience, visual design, interface design, and strategy offerings, we needed a new site &ndash; one with case studies and an emphasis on design, not just technology. The new site also reflects our growing clarity about our principles and evangelizes our values and culture. The new site should release in April 2014 after we finish up our case studies.</p>
