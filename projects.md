Outside of my day job, I try to give back to those earlier in their careers and build the design community of my city.

## ChiPD: Chicago Product Designers

ChiPD calls attention to the burgeoning product design scene in Chicago by featuring those doing the best work, calling out some amazing job opportunities, and cataloging the best in product design resources.

## The Starter League

Most quarters I mentor visual designers at [The Starter League](http://starterleague.com). The experience has been very rewarding, as it gives me an opportunity to reflect on what it was like to be a beginner and allows me to lend a hand to the next generation.

## AIGA Chicago

The Chicago chapter of the AIGA operates the largest, most successful design mentorship program in the country. It's been a privilege and an honor to mentor 10-12 junior designers and help them do better work.
