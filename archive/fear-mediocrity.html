<h1>Fear Mediocrity</h1>
<p>There are few things I loathe more in life than mediocrity. Now, I know my life in the grand scheme of things will matter very little. Even the most significant people in history (Socrates, Jesus, MLK, Kim Kardashian) will be forgotten when the sun dies and the history of our planet with it. However, despite these realities, I feel compelled to aspire to be exceptional, not at everything, but at least at one or two things.</p>
<p>Most days I&rsquo;m surrounded by men, women, boys and girls very content to fill out the center of the bell-curve. Mediocrity isn&rsquo;t a problem, C&rsquo;s are adequate, fulfilling requirements equals success, et cetera. It&rsquo;s a stench, a haze, enabling everyone else to settle for less, making barely trying acceptable. For some reason or another, it drives me batshit crazy to see people working toward careers or in careers that they&rsquo;re wildly mediocre at, but not even that bothers me as much as embracing the mediocrity and calling it exceptional. I recognize that as designers, artists, and makers of things we will wage a long, arduous battle to fight off mediocrity and begin making exceptional work, but don&rsquo;t settle early and call the middling gold.</p>
<p>My exhortation to all: explore your passions, discover your interests, do something to engage the most central part of your being. A poorly lit cubicle, in a dusty basement, both literally and metaphorically is no place for a living, breathing human being.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all going to be mediocre at a lot of things and below average at a few more things too. But come on people, life is too damn short to waste forty hours a week doing something that&rsquo;s just fine. I encourage all of you to make the hard choice: hone your craft and become exceptional through hard work and a labor of love or peace the fuck out and find something to love. (Option three, support your family, put in your time to get a check, but start taking baby steps toward option one or two PLEASE.)</p>
<p>Now, I understand, my fear of mediocrity may not be rational, but doesn&rsquo;t it just feel good to be fully engaged? So into something that your lose track of time, don&rsquo;t really care how much you get paid, and can&rsquo;t wait to get started when you wake in the morning? The bottom line is: it&rsquo;s in our interest, both yours and mine, to engage with our work out of love because, to be honest, we have a lot of it ahead of us.</p>
