Jason is a product & brand designer repping Chicago on the West Coast. His work and work ethic are both deeply influenced by his Midwestern, blue-collar, modest upbringing in Northern Illinois. When not working, he plays with his two cats, Whiskey and Ringo, and drinks bourbon with his wife while watching HBO.
